# QR Recognition and 3D Model Processing

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **QR Code recognition** and **3D model processing**. The goal is to scan QR codes and associate them with 3D models, which can be rendered or processed dynamically. The project uses computer vision techniques to detect QR codes and display corresponding 3D models, creating an interactive experience.

## Features
- **QR Code Recognition**: The system can scan QR codes from images or live video and identify their content.
- **3D Model Processing**: After detecting the QR code, the system loads and displays the related 3D model (e.g., an object, structure, or scene).
- **Interactive Visualization**: The 3D model can be manipulated, rotated, or zoomed in/out to provide a better understanding of the object or scene.
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates QR code scanning with the processing and visualization of 3D models.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For the core development of the system.
- **OpenCV**: For QR code recognition and image processing.
- **3D Libraries (e.g., PyOpenGL)**: For rendering and manipulating 3D models.
- **Flask/Django (if applicable)**: For creating a web interface (if your project includes a web-based application).

## Installation

To get started with this project locally, follow the instructions below:

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x). You also need `pip` to install dependencies.

### Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mahendrakoppuravuri1/QR_Recognition_and_3DModel_Processing-1-.git
cd QR_Recognition_and_3DModel_Processing-1-
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project
To run the QR code recognition and 3D model processing, execute the following command:
```bash
python app.py
```

If your project includes a web interface:
```bash
flask run
```
Or for Django:
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Usage
- Open the application.
- Use the webcam or upload an image containing a QR code.
- The system will scan the QR code and load the corresponding 3D model.
- Interact with the 3D model through zooming or rotating to explore it.

## Project Structure
- `app.py`: Main application file containing the QR recognition and 3D model rendering logic.
- `models/`: Directory where 3D models are stored.
- `static/`: Contains static assets like images or JS for web-based projects.
- `templates/`: HTML templates for web-based projects (if applicable).
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Future Improvements
- **Enhancing QR recognition**: Improve QR scanning speed and accuracy with better models or image processing techniques.
- **Advanced 3D interactions**: Implement more advanced controls for interacting with 3D models, such as animations or multi-object rendering.
- **Web or Mobile App**: Expand the project to create a mobile app or improve the web app with more features and better UX.

## Acknowledgments
- OpenCV for QR code recognition.
- PyOpenGL (or other 3D libraries) for rendering 3D models.

### Steps to Add README:

1. **Create the README file**: In your project directory, create a file named `README.md`.
2. **Paste the content**: Copy the above content and paste it into the `README.md` file.
3. **Customize it**: Modify the installation instructions, project structure, and other details based on the exact nature of your project.
4. **Commit the README**: 
   After creating or updating the README file, add it to your Git repository and push it to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "Add README file with project details"
   git push
   ```
